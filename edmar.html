                <p>I played basketball since grade 3 and through the years I always trained 
                    hard to be able to compete in a major league. Playing basketball makes me happy and 
                    helps me to gain new friends and as well as to prioritize my health.</p>

                <p>After the pandemic, the cycling community boomed and inspired me to become a cyclist. I have been to Padre Pio, Baguio, 
                    and many other places. Cycling has strengthened my 
                    immune system, and cardiovascular health, and allowed me to travel to many beautiful places in the Philippines.</p>

                <p>The first sport I participated in was Taekwondo. It taught me many things and it's not always about
                    fighting but rather self-defense and discipline to use martial arts in a good way. I had been into a milo cup
                and mayor's cup, and I won silver in the age of 9. This sports will always be epic for me.</p>

                    <p class="sdg-paragraph">The third SDG strives to promote healthy lives and 
                        well-being for all by addressing critical global health issues such as 
                        maternity and child health, infectious illnesses, noncommunicable diseases, 
                        and mental health. It pushes for universal health coverage, which ensures 
                        that everyone has access to high-quality care without financial burden. The goal 
                        also emphasizes the significance of resilient health systems that can address 
                        both current and emerging health problems. Finally, SDG 3 aims to promote longer, 
                        healthier lives and minimize health disparities worldwide.</p>

                    <p class="sdg-paragraph">The third SDG, which focuses on good health and well-being, is crucial because 
                        it has a direct impact on people's capacity to lead happy, fruitful lives. People cannot realize 
                        their full potential if they do not have access to high-quality healthcare, education, and a 
                        healthy diet. This objective highlights the significance of preventing illnesses and fostering
                         mental health, acknowledging that well-being is the capacity to flourish rather than merely 
                         the absence of disease. Communities become stronger and more resilient when everyone is healthy. 
                         Society can thrive and promote equality and opportunity for everyone when everyone is healthy.</p>

                        frequent exercise, and abstaining from dangerous behaviors such as smoking, is 
                        essential for preventing health difficulties. Regular check-ups and vaccines 
                        can help detect health problems early on. Supporting public health programs and 
                        educating communities about health hazards enables people to make educated decisions. By 
                        combining individual responsibility with community actions, we can drastically reduce 
                        preventable diseases and increase general well-being.</p>
